In religious texts four types of Ekadashi fasting has been mentioned. 1. Jalahar Nirjala Ekadashi 2. Ksheerbhoji 3. Phalahari 4. Naktabhoji (नक्तभोजी) i.e. having single meal in a day just before sunset. Single meal should not have any variety of grains and cereals including beans, wheat, rice and pulses which are forbidden during Ekadashi fasting. Staple diet for Naktabhoji during Ekadashi fasting includes Sabudana , Singhada (Water caltrop and also known as Chestnut), Shakarkandi , Potatoes and Groundnuts . For many Kuttu Atta (BuckWheat Flour) and Samak (Millet Rice) is also staple diet during single Ekadashi meal. However validity of both items as Ekadashi food is debatable as those are considered semi-grains or pseudo grains. It is better to avoid these items during fasting. Ekadashi Fasting FAQ 1. What is meant by Ekadashi Tithi Begins and Ekadashi Tithi Ends? 2. Should I begin fast when Ekadashi Tithi Begins? No. As we mentioned above Tithi begin time is not needed for Ekadashi fasting. Ekadashi fasting always begins with Sunrise and mostly ends after next day Sunrise. Ekadashi is usually 24 hours fasting observed form local Sunrise to next Sunrise. 3. Sometimes you list two consecutive dates for Ekadashi. What does it mean? 4. What is Parana time? 5. What is Hari Vasara End moment? Many people observe Ekadashi Vrat as well as Pradosh Vrat 7. What to do if Ekadashi fast is broken? In Hindu religious texts, Ekadashi fast has been described as the most sacred and fruitful fast. The fast of Ekadashi is dedicated to Lord Vishnu Following solutions can be taken if Ekadashi fast is broken - First, take a bath again in clothes. Do Abhisheka of Lord Vishnu with Panchamrita mixed with milk, curd, honey and sugar. Do Shodashopachara Puja of Lord Vishnu. While apologizing to the Lord, chant the following Mantra - मन्त्रहीनं क्रियाहीनं भक्तिहीनं जनार्दन। यत्पूजितं मया देव परिपूर्ण तदस्तु मे॥ ॐ श्री विष्णवे नमः। क्षमा याचनाम् समर्पयामि॥ Mantrahinam Kriyahinam Bhaktihinam Janardana। Yatpujitam Maya Deva Paripurna Tadastu Me॥ Om Shri Vishnave Namah Kshama Yachanam Samarpayami॥ Offer feast to cows, Brahmins and girls. After breaking the fast, chant Lord Vishnu's Dvadshakshara Mantra Om Namo Bhagwate Vasudevaya Recite the hymns of Lord Vishnu devotionally. Donate yellow clothes, fruits, sweets, religious scriptures, gram pulses, turmeric, saffron etc. to the priest in the temple of Lord Vishnu. If you miss the fast of Ekadashi by mistake, then you can repent and take the resolution of Nirjala Ekadashi , which is instructed to be kept Nirjala i.e. without water and food. Fasting and worship etc. are completely a matter of reverence and devotion. Therefore, even if you commit any mistake during the fast due to ignorance, have full faith in your deity and apologize to him. There is no need to be afraid but do not behave arbitrarily during the fast under laziness and carelessness. Lord Shri Hari Vishnu is completely aware of the feelings of all living beings and provides results accordingly.
